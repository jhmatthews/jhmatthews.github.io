intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I'm an astrophysics PhD student studying at the University of Southampton.
    My research involves using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to model 
    accretion disk winds and the spectral features they produce. 
    I am supervised by Professor Christian Knigge. You can find more details
    on my research, outreach and publications below.
